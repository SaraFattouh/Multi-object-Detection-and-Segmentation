# Multi-object-Detection-and-Segmentation
### Description In this assignment you have to build a Mask R-CNN based instance segmentation model using [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). Detectron2 was written in PyTorch and contains many state-of-the-art obejct detection models with pretrained weights. (*Don't worry, you don't have to use any PyTorch specific function, just the methods provided by the Detectron2 package.*)   First, you have to convert the Simpsons Main Characters dataset to COCO format. After that, finetune a pretrained instance segmentation model (which was trained on COCO dataset) to segment Simpson characters.
